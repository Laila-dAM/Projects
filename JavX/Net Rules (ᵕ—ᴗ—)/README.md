# Internet Rules 

## What is it?

A Java console application that humorously displays one of the legendary "Rules of the Internet" based on the number you input.  
From Rule 0 to Rule 62 — this project captures a strange and chaotic slice of early internet culture, right from your terminal.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the program:

```bash
javac InternetRules.java
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
java InternetRules
```

4. When prompted, enter:

- Enter a number between 0 and 62
- The corresponding internet rule will be displayed in the terminal

## Features

- Covers 63 classic internet rules from 0 to 62
- Console-based interaction with a retro aesthetic
- Includes emojis, sarcasm, absurdity, and underground net lore
- Simple structure for easy customization and experimentation
- No API, no dependencies — just pure terminal fun
