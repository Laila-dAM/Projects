## What is it?

A Java console game with a splash of ASCII style.  
Swim through a grid-based ocean, collect pearls (`*`), and avoid deadly predators (`X`).  
Move using WASD, see your score grow, and survive the deep!

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the game:

```bash
javac game.java
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
javac SurvivalGame
```

4. When prompted, enter:

- A movement key: W (up), A (left), S (down), or D (right)

## Features

- 2D ASCII map rendered directly in the console
