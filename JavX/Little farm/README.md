# Little Farm 

## What is it?

A Java console application that simulates a retro-style farm game. 
Manage crops, animals, food, and money — all through text-based choices, pop-ups, and kaomoji charm. It's a minimalist farming sim where every choice matters.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the program:

```bash
javac farm.java
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
java farm
```

4. In-game actions:

- Plant crops to grow your farm
- Feed animals using food
- Sell crops to earn money
- Buy food to sustain your animals
- Keep an eye on your stats and don't let your resources run out!

## Features

- Console-based simulation with ASCII frames and pop-ups
- Track four core stats: crops, animals, food, and money
- Interactive UI with JOptionPane for feedback
- Includes cute kaomojis and emoji-based storytelling
- Easy to expand with new actions or resource types
