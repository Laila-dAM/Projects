# Academic Analyzer

## What is it?

An R script that analyzes student grades by calculating the class average, classifying performance, and generating a visual distribution of scores. It automatically builds a report summarizing each student's rating and highlights those who performed above average.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have [R installed](https://cran.r-project.org/).

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and run the script:

```bash
Rscript analisadoracademico.R
```

3. The script will:
- Calculate the average grade
- Identify students above the average
- Assign a rating to each grade (Excellent, Good, Regular, Insufficient)
- Generate a histogram of grade distribution (Rplots.pdf)

## Features

- Calculates class average using mean()
- Classifies student performance with nested ifelse()
- Creates a complete report using data.frame()
- Filters students above average
- Visualizes data using a histogram

## Folder Structure

```bash
📁 Academic Analyzer/
├── analisadoracademico.R      # Main analysis script
├── analisa.mp4                # Demo video (optional)
├── Rplots.pdf                 # Generated histogram plot
