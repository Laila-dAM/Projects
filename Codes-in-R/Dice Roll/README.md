# Dice Roll

## What is it?

An R script that simulates 1000 rolls of a six-sided die, then compares the theoretical and real probabilities of each face appearing. It outputs frequency counts, probability values, and a visual bar chart of the results.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have [R installed](https://cran.r-project.org/).

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and run the script:

```bash
Rscript dice.R
```

3. The script will:
- Simulate 1000 dice rolls
- Print the frequency and probabilities
- Generate a bar chart of face frequencies (Rplots.pdf)

## Features

- Simulates a large sample of dice rolls with sample()
- Compares real and theoretical probabilities
- Outputs clear statistical data in the terminal
- Visualizes results with a colored bar chart

## Folder Structure

```bash
📁 Dice Roll/
├── dice.R              # Main simulation script
├── dice.mp4            # Demo video (optional)
├── Rplots.pdf          # Generated frequency plot
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```
