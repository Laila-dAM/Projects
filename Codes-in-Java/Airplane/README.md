Create a simple flight simulator where the user can control the altitude and speed of an airplane and try to keep the aircraft stable during flight. Components: The program should allow the user to adjust the airplane's speed and altitude in real-time. It should simulate the effects of acceleration and deceleration on the flight, affecting the airplane's behavior (such as ascents or descents). The user must maintain the airplane at a constant altitude and within a safe speed range, avoiding collisions with the ground or other obstacles. Challenge: Add a simulation of weather conditions, such as wind and turbulence, which affect the flight and require the pilot to adjust controls to maintain aircraft stability.
