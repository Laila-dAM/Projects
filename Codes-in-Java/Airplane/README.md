# Airplane

## What is it?

A Java console simulation where you control a virtual airplane by adjusting its altitude and speed while reacting to random weather conditions like wind and turbulence. Your mission is to keep the aircraft flying safely without crashing or stalling.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the game:

```bash
javac air.java
```

3. Run the simulation:

```bash
java air
```

4. During execution, you will be prompted to:

- Increase or decrease the altitude
- Increase or decrease the speed
- Monitor wind and turbulence
- Avoid crashing, stalling, or flying too fast

## Features

- Console interface for altitude and speed control
- Randomized weather simulation (wind speed and turbulence)
- Alerts for extreme flight conditions
- Logical flight limits and crash detection
- Looping gameplay until safe exit or game over

## Folder Structure

```bash
📁 Airplane/
├── air.java                # Main application code
├── air.mp4                 # Demo video of the simulation
└── README.md               # Project documentation
