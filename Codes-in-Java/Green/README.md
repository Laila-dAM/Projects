# Smart Greenhouse Simulator

## What is it?

A Java console application that simulates a smart greenhouse environment. You can register plants, adjust environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, light), and estimate how long each plant will take to grow based on those conditions.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the code:

```bash
javac green.java
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
java SmartGreenhouseSimulator
```

4. From the menu, you can:
- Add a new plant with its ideal growth time
- Adjust the temperature, humidity, and light intensity of the greenhouse
- View registered plants and see estimated growth times based on current conditions

## Features

- Add and manage multiple plant types
- Simulate changes in environmental conditions
- Warns you when conditions are outside optimal ranges
- Dynamically calculates plant growth time based on environment
- Simple CLI interface for interactive use

## Folder Structure

```bash
📁 Green/
├── green.java         # Main application logic (SmartGreenhouseSimulator)
├── green.mp4          # Demo video (optional)
