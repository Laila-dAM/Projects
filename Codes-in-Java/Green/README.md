Create a program that simulates plant growth in a smart greenhouse with control over temperature, humidity, and light.Components: The program should allow the user to add different plant types, with details such as name, type, and ideal growth time. It should simulate the greenhouse environment with adjustable variables for temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The program should calculate and display the estimated time for each plant to reach its ideal growth stage, considering the environment conditions and plant type. Challenge: Implement alarm functionalities to notify the user when the temperature or humidity falls outside the optimal range for plant growth.
