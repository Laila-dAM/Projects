# Hungry Danet

## What is it?

A Java Swing-based 2D game where you navigate a cute character underwater, collecting good items (like 🍓 and 🍰) and avoiding bad ones (like 🥦 and 🌶️). Reach 100 points to win — or get too many penalties and it's game over. Featuring kaomoji feedback for victory or defeat!

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the game:

```bash
javac Game.java
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
java Game
```

4. Use arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to move the character:
- 🍓, 🍦, 🍰 increase your score
- 🧊, 🥦, 🌶️ decrease your score

5. Game ends when:
- You reach 100+ points (Victory)
- Your score goes below 0 (Game Over)

6. Press R to restart the game when it ends.

## Features

- Colorful 2D environment using Java Swing
- Collectibles with varying point values and emojis
- Real-time collision detection
- Game-over conditions with visual feedback (kaomojis!)
- Keyboard controls and restart functionality
