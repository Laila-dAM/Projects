# Memorytrix

## What is it?

A C console game that tests your short-term memory by displaying a randomized pattern of blocks and challenging you to reconstruct it from memory. Perfect for sharpening your focus (or melting your brain cells).

## How to play?

1. Compile the main C file:

```bash
gcc memorytrix -o memorytrix
```

2. Run the game:

```bash
./memorytrix
```

3. Gameplay flow:

- A 5x5 grid will show a random pattern using "█" and "·".
- You’ll have a few seconds to memorize it.
- The screen clears and you must recreate the pattern by entering 1 for block (█) and 0 for dot (·) for each cell.
- If your memory is perfect, you win. If not… well, try again.

## Features
- Generates randomized visual patterns (5x5 grid)
- Terminal-based visual feedback using Unicode blocks
- Memory-based challenge with time pressure
- Clean screen transition for realistic challenge
- Simple CLI interface and fun messages
