# Memory Matrix Game

This is a simple C program that simulates a memory game where the user must memorize and reconstruct a randomly generated binary matrix.

## Features
- A matrix of size 5x5 is randomly generated and displayed to the user.
- The user has 3 attempts to reconstruct the matrix correctly.
- The program compares the user's input with the original matrix and gives feedback on success or failure.

## How to Play
1. The program generates a 5x5 binary matrix and asks you to memorize it.
2. After a short delay, the matrix is ​​hidden.
3. You have 3 attempts to reconstruct the matrix. Input your reconstructed matrix using `0` and `1`.
4. If you reconstruct the matrix correctly, you win! If not, you get another chance.
5. If you fail after 3 attempts, the correct matrix is ​​displayed.
