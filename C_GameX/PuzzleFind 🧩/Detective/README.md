# Detective

## What is it?

A C terminal-based puzzle game where you become a digital detective. Investigate encrypted and reversed data files, apply basic cryptography logic, and uncover secret messages hidden in binary. The player solves two core puzzles: XOR decryption and string reversal.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (like `gcc`).

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the game:

```bash
gcc detetivedata.c -o detective_game
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
./detective_game
```

4. The game will automatically:

- Decrypt encrypted_file.dat using XOR with a key
- Write the decrypted message to decrypted_file.txt
- Reverse the string content of encoded_file.dat and reveal the result in the terminal

## Features

- XOR decryption logic with fixed key
- File-based puzzle interaction
- Reversal puzzle challenge
- Terminal output with interactive feedback
- Simulated "detective" experience with simple C logic

## Folder Structure

```bash
📁 Detective/
├── detetivedata.c            # Main application logic
├── detective_game            # Compiled executable
├── encrypted_file.dat        # Encrypted binary input
├── encoded_file.dat          # Reversed string input
├── decrypted_file.txt        # Output from decryption
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
