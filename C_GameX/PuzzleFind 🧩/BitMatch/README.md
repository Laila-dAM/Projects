# BitMatch

## What is it?

A fast-paced C console game that challenges your reflexes and binary skills. BitMatch generates a 4x4 grid of pseudo-random 4-bit numbers, and your goal is to identify patterns and score as much as possible within the time limit.

## How to play?

1. Compile the main C file:

```bash
gcc bit.c -o bitmatch
```

2. Run the game:
```bash
./bitmatch
```

3. Gameplay loop:

- A 4x4 grid of 4-bit values is generated (e.g., 1101, 0010).
- You interact with the grid (game logic to be expanded).
- Time is limited — react fast and match patterns accurately!
- Score as high as you can before the timer runs out.

> ℹ️ The current implementation initializes and displays randomized binary patterns. Game logic can be extended to support matching challenges or memory-based rounds.

## Features
- Generates 4x4 grid of randomized 4-bit binary numbers
- Dynamic and time-based structure (30-second timer)
- Compact grid generation using bitwise logic
- Expandable gameplay (ideal for puzzle/minigame integrations)
- CLI-based interface with potential for score system
