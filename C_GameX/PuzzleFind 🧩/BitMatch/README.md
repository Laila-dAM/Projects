# BitMatch

**BitMatch** is a memory game on a 4x4 grid, where the goal is to match pairs of identical binary numbers before time runs out.

## How to play

- The 4x4 grid contains random 4-digit binary numbers (such as 1010, 1101, etc.).
- The player must enter two positions of the grid (x1 y1 x2 y2) to try to form a pair.
- If the binary numbers in both positions are the same, the pair is removed and the player scores points.
- The game has a time limit of 30 seconds. For each pair found, the player scores 10 points.
