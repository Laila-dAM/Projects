# Reverse Logic

## What is it?

A C console game that challenges your brain with twisted logical statements. Instead of following a rule, your task is to think backwards — identifying the opposite meaning and providing clever counter-responses to common situations.

## How to play?

1. Compile the main C file:

```bash
gcc Reverse.c -o Reverse
```

2. Run the game:

```bash
./Reverse
```

3. Gameplay instructions:
- You'll receive a "normal" rule (e.g., If the alarm rings, wake up).
- You'll be asked to provide the opposite condition or consequence.
- You have 3 attempts per challenge to get it right.
- Solve all 10 challenges to prove your reverse reasoning skills!

> Tip: Some answers accept variations like "alarm is off" or "no alarm" — use your wits.

## Features

- 10 creative logic-reversal challenges
- Dynamic input checking with flexible answers
- Limited attempts for added tension
- Fun feedback with expressive emoji-style reactions
- CLI interface with clean flow and formatting
