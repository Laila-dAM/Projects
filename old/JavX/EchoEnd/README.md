# EchoEnd

## What is it?

A terminal-based Java survival game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  

Scavenge for food, gather resources, build shelter, explore ruins, and try to survive — all while a hint of hope lingers in the form of an NPC waiting to be rescued.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the game:

```bash
javac SurvivalGame.java
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
javac SurvivalGame
```

4. Interact using the terminal:
- Choose actions like searching, building, or resting
- Your goal is to stay alive as long as possible
- Rescue the NPC and manage your food, health and shelter

## Features

- Simple survival mechanics with random events
- Dynamic pop-up messages using Swing
- Text-based status HUD with emoji-enhanced feedback
- Resource collection, NPC interactions and day-by-day decisions
- ASCII-styled UI with end-of-game feedback

## Folder Structure

```bash
