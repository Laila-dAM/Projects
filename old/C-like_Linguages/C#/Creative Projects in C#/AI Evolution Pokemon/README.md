# AI Evolution Pokemon

## What is it?

A simple console-based simulation that models the evolution of fictional creatures (Pokémon-style) under different environmental conditions. Users can configure climate, mutation rate, resource scarcity, and observe how a population adapts across generations.

## How to use?

1. Make sure you have [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed.

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and build the program:

```bash
dotnet build
```

3. Run the simulation:
```bash
dotnet run
```

4. Follow the prompts in the terminal to:
- Choose climate (hot, cold, or neutral)
- Set a mutation rate (between 0.01 and 1.0)
- Select resource scarcity level (low, medium, or high)
- Define number of generations and initial population size

Features
- Customizable environmental parameters
- Simulated evolution across generations
- Fitness evaluation and natural selection logic
- Random mutations and reproduction
- CLI-based, no external libraries
