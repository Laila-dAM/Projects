# 📁 Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal projects repository — a single space where I organize everything I create, study, and experiment with.  
This repository is structured into folders to keep all content clean, categorized, and easy to navigate.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Inside this repository, you will find two main sections:

- **📁 neo/** — Newer or currently active projects  
- **📁 old/** — Older projects, experiments, and studies

Each folder may contain additional subfolders and project directories.

---

## 🧭 Navigation Icons

To make navigation simpler, each project or folder has a README explaining what it contains.  
Inside those READMEs, the following icons are used:

- **📁** — Represents a folder used to organize content  
- **👾** — Represents a project, exercise, game, or piece of code  

These icons help differentiate between organizational folders and actual work.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This is a central hub for:

- Personal coding projects  
- College assignments and exercises  
- Small games and prototypes  
- Programming language studies  
- Experiments, notes, and archived material  

By keeping everything in one well-structured repository, I can track my growth over time and easily revisit older ideas.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Each major folder or project contains its own `README.md` with details.  
- The structure may expand over time as new languages, tools, or ideas appear.  
- Some older directories may include legacy or experimental code kept for reference.
