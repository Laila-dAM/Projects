# Reality Show Simulator 

## What is it?

A C++ console simulation of a dramatic reality show elimination game. Participants compete through random events, healing items, and surprise eliminations — until only one remains. With a mix of luck and suspense, the simulator narrates every twist and turn like a real TV show.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`).

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the project:

```bash
g++ show.cxx -o show
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
./show
```

4. Watch the show unfold round by round. Participants will:

- Experience random events (health gain/loss)
- Be eliminated dramatically
- Fight to be the last one standing!

## Features

- Simulates a turn-based elimination reality show
- Each round includes:
A random event (damage or healing)
One dramatic elimination
- Colorful participant names and commentary from a fictional narrator
- Displays health status of all contestants in real time
- Declares a final winner when only one participant remains
