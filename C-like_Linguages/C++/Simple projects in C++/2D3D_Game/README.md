# 2D Game Engine 

## What is it?

A simple 2D game engine written in C++ using SFML. It opens a window with a movable green circle controlled by the keyboard arrow keys. A basic example for learning game loops, rendering, and event handling with SFML.

## How to play?

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) and SFML installed.

2. Compile the project by running:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread engine.cxx -o engine -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

3. Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./engine
```

4. Control the green circle using the arrow keys. Close the window to exit.

## Features

- Opens an 800x600 window titled "2D Game Engine"
- Renders a green circle that can be moved with arrow keys
- Handles window close events properly
- Simple game loop with event handling, updating, and rendering
