# C Projects

This folder contains C projects organized by type and complexity:

- **Simple projects in C**  
  Small and beginner-friendly programs, focused on syntax, logic, and basic structures.

- **Creative Projects in C**  
  Experiments and creative programs, sometimes using terminal tricks, ASCII art, or quirky ideas.

- **Complex Projects in C**  
  Larger C programs with multiple files, modular structure, and more advanced programming concepts.

These folders represent different stages in my journey learning and applying the C language.
