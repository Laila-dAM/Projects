This project creates a simple movie database with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It uses dynamic memory allocation with malloc, free, and realloc to store and manage movies, and employs structures such as lists or arrays to organize the data. The system allows the user to add, edit, delete, and search for movies, with the data saved to a file for persistence. The program interacts with the terminal, manipulates strings, and prevents memory leaks. The challenges include optimizing search and ensuring efficiency with large volumes of data.
