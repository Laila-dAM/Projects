# CodeAnalyzer 

## What is it?

A C console application that analyzes C source code by performing lexical analysis, parsing, error checking, and generating reports and visualizations. It helps developers understand and inspect their code structure through automated analysis.

## How to use?

1. Make sure you have a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the `build/` directory and compile the project using the provided Makefile:

```bash
cd build
```

3. Run the application with a source file:

```bash
./code_analyzer ../data/sample_code.c
```

4. The program will:

- Tokenize the input C code
- Parse its structure
- Check for syntax errors
- Generate a report and visualizations

## Features

- Performs lexical analysis and token generation
- Parses code to analyze its structure
- Detects syntax-level errors
- Generates structured reports and charts
- Modular design with headers and C source files
- Uses Python scripts for enhanced reporting and visuals

## Folder Structure

```bash
📁 CodeAnalyzer/
├── build/                    # Build system (Makefile)
├── data/                     # Sample input C code
├── include/                  # Header files (lexer, parser, error handling)
├── reports/                  # Python report generator
├── src/                      # Main C source code
│   └── main.c                # Entry point of the application
├── visualizations/           # Python scripts for generating visual output
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```
