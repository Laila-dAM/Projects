# Cyberparasitism Simulator

## What is it?

A C-based console simulation where a virus attempts to infect an immune system. The virus adapts its strategy based on difficulty level and defense patterns, making each simulation dynamic and unpredictable. Inspired by concepts of parasitism and adaptive evolution.

## How to use?

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`).

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the code:

```bash
gcc Simulador.c -o Simulador
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
./Simulador
```

4. The simulation starts automatically with Medium difficulty. You can change this by modifying the difficulty variable inside main() in the source code.

## Features
- Virus vs Immune System combat simulation
- Randomized attack and defense patterns
- Adaptive virus behavior on higher difficulties
- Clean CLI output for step-by-step tracking
- Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard

## Folder Structure
```bash
📁 Cyberparasitism/
├── Simulador.c        # Main source code
├── Simulador          # Compiled executable (after build)
├── simulador.mp4      # Demo video of the simulation
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```
