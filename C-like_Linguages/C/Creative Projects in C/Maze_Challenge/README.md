This is a simple interactive maze game developed in C. The player starts at a starting point (marked 'S') and must navigate through different mazes until they reach the exit (marked 'E'). The game offers five levels with different maze layouts and challenges the player to use the w, a, s, d commands to move through each one. At each level, the player faces new obstacles and, upon reaching the exit, advances to the next level. If the player hits the walls, they are informed of the error and must try again. The goal is to complete all the levels and reach the end of the game, receiving a congratulations message.
