# Maze Challenge

## What is it?

A C console-based puzzle game where the player must navigate through multiple ASCII-art labyrinths using keyboard controls. Avoid walls, find the exits, and complete all levels to win! The game features 5 unique handcrafted maze levels and playful status messages to guide the experience.

## How to use?

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`).

2. Open a terminal in the project folder and compile the project:

```bash
gcc kao.c -o kao
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
./kao
```

4. Use the following keys to move:
- w = up
- s = down
- a = left
- d = right
- q = quit the game

> Progress through each maze by reaching the E (exit) starting from S (start). Avoid walls (|, /, \)!

## Features
- 5 unique levels with increasing complexity
- Wall collision detection
- Cute emoji-based player feedback
- Simple CLI controls for movement
- ASCII-style labyrinth visuals
- Restart position and level progression after each win
