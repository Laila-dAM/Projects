# ASCII Space Colonization Simulator

Welcome to the **ASCII Space Colonization Simulator**, a text-based strategy game where players manage resources, solve environmental challenges, and make critical decisions to establish and maintain a successful space colony. The game features an immersive ASCII-based interface and blends strategic gameplay with physics-based simulations.

## Features

- **ASCII Map**: Navigate planets, bases, and resources using a visually intuitive map where symbols represent different elements:
  - `#`: Mountains
  - `~`: Water
  - `*`: Resources
  - Other symbols for bases, events, and terrain.
  
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and control key resources such as:
  - Food
  - Oxygen
  - Energy
  - Construction Materials

- **Dynamic Events**: Encounter unpredictable scenarios like:
  - Environmental challenges: Dust storms, volcanic eruptions.
  - Technical problems: Equipment malfunctions, resource shortages.

- **Strategic Decisions**: Make impactful choices to:
  - Expand your base.
  - Explore new areas.
  - Optimize resource usage.

- **Exploration**: Send teams to uncover hidden areas of the ASCII map and gather valuable resources.

## Technologies

This project uses a combination of C# and C++ to deliver a dynamic and seamless experience:
- **C#**: Handles the gameâ€™s interface, logic, and user interactions.
- **C++**: Implements simulations for physics (gravity, movement) and resource optimization.

## Challenges

Developing this game involves overcoming key challenges:
1. Creating an engaging and dynamic experience using a purely ASCII-based interface.
2. Designing intuitive and functional ASCII symbols and descriptions for effective gameplay.
3. Implementing an unpredictable event system to keep gameplay challenging without relying on graphics or sound.
