# Chemical Reaction Simulator

## Description
The Chemical Reaction Simulator is a console-based application that allows users to simulate various chemical reactions and visualize the effects. The available reactions include:

1. **Methane Combustion**: Simulates the combustion of methane (CH₄).
2. **Acid-Base Neutralization**: Simulates the neutralization reaction between Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and Sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
3. **Precipitate Formation**: Simulates the formation of a precipitate in the reaction between Silver nitrate (AgNO₃) and Sodium chloride (NaCl).

The simulator allows users to interact with the simulation by adjusting temperature and pressure variables during each reaction.

## Features
- Simulate chemical reactions with visual effects (e.g., flames, smoke, water).
- Adjust temperature and pressure during the reaction process.
- Repeat reactions or exit the simulator as desired.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- For **C#** version: Ensure you have a .NET runtime installed.
- For **C++** version: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (such as g++).

### How to Run

#### C# Version
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `main.cs` file in a C# IDE or editor.
3. Run the program using the `.NET` runtime:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
